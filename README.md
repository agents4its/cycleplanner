Cycle planner

Cycle planner is capable to compute a route for cyclists from a given origin to a destination. When calculating the route, a length of the route, changes in elevation, an average speed of a cyclist, properties of the route segments and requirements of a user are considered.
Currently, the cycle planner is developed by Jan Hrnčíř, Pavol Žilecký, and Qing Song under the supervision of Michal Jakob at Agent Technology Center, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague.
Originally, Open Bicycle Trip Planner has been designed and implemented during the bachelor project of Marcel Német under the supervision of Jan Hrnčíř and Michal Jakob.
Web frontend of the cycle planner is accessible at:
