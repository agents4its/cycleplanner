# Multi-Criteria Cycle planner

Cycle planner is capable to compute a route for cyclists from a given origin to a destination. When calculating the route, three criteria are used: **travel time, comfort, and elevation gain**.

Currently, the cycle planner is developed by **Jan Hrnčíř** and **Pavol Žilecký** under the supervision of **Michal Jakob** at [Agent Technology Center](http://agents.fel.cvut.cz/projects/agents4its), Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague.

**Multi-criteria web frontend of the cycle planner is accessible at:**
